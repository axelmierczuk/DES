DES in C
########
Overview
========
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is a simple implementation of encryption that demonstrates
the steps done while computing the encrypted text.

Compilation & Installation
==========================
This has only been tested on a Unix machine but you may be able to compile and run the program on a Windows machine.

To compile: cd to the file directory and compile the file with gcc compiler (i.e. gcc DES.c).

To run: In the same directory, a file titled 'a.out' will be created. Run it by issuing ./a.out for example, then follow the prompts.
